# MaxMin using Python

## 📌 Project Overview

**MaxMin using Python** is a simple Python project that identifies the **maximum** and **minimum** values from a list of numbers. This script demonstrates fundamental Python concepts like list manipulation, loops, built-in functions, and user input handling.

The program reads a set of integers, evaluates them, and prints both the maximum and minimum values. This is a common problem for beginners to understand algorithmic thinking and Python basics.

## 🧠 Problem Description

Given a list of integers (either hardcoded or provided by the user), the script determines:
- The **largest (maximum)** number in the list  
- The **smallest (minimum)** number in the list

This project helps reinforce Python skills, especially working with lists and comparison operations.
